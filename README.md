My role in this project was to create a nonSQL database API via mongo. 
The decisions I made was creating a very small API and trying to navigate it smoohtly and cleanly. 
I spent a lot of time in the project frustrated and redownloading homebrew, my mentor used VIM to get into my terminal and found the root of the problem and fixed this issue of having the redownload homebrew. I was definitely frustrated because I spent a chunk of the achievement confused about these types of consistent issues and felt that I didn't have the support until I finally got on a call with my mentor. I will be calling him more.
