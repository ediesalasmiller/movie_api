My role in this project was to create a nonSQL database API via mongo. 
The decisions I made was creating a very small API and trying to navigate it smoohtly and cleanly. 
I spent a lot of time in the project troubleshooting, my mentor used VIM to get into my terminal and found the root of the problem and fixed the issue of having the redownload homebrew. 
App name is located in MongoDB.com : edieflixdb used to heroku commands in terminal.
